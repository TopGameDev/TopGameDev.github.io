                    As a kid I played around with a lot of tech. I would dismantle computers so i could see what was inside. I would also try to make them faster. I started animating when I was 13, my first animation software was 3ds Max. I also used to play with rpg makers and game creation softwares because I was always so infatuated with game creation and design. I loved anything that had to do with me and a computer. Then came sports, I dedicated my entire youth to developing my athletic abilities. My mother was an All-American basketball player when she was in college, so when my brother and I decided to play basketball she was thrilled. Until she found out we couldnt walk and chew gum at the same time haha. From that point on my brother and I would spend most days 10-12 hours a day from 8-9 am to 8-9 pm practicing non-stop basketball, and baseball. Sometimes my mother would just say "Go outside and shoot/hit the ball" and we would do just that with her occasional guidance or we just went outside and practiced ourselves. We became promising athletes around 8th grade and began getting offered scholarships from private schools and some of the top highschools around because of our potential. Through it all, I obtained rank 1 in Louisiana. Then my parents decided to move to Texas in the middle of my sophmore year of highschool and I obtained ranks in the top 100 players in the state and top 10 in Houston. Then in my junior year of highschool the letters started flooding in. We had crates of college letters. Even with all the time I dedicated to sports. I was always working on something on the tech side of things. Even if that ment I had to stay up late at night to work on it.

                <h1>Why Web Development?</h1>

                    Why do I want to be a web developer? Well, that's simple. I like to build things and I'm an Artist at heart, I love to organize and re-arrange things to make them look Abstract, or mind bending and Opaque, or just down right cool. This type of work is right up my alley. Ive been designing since I was young. I also have always wanted to make my own website from scratch. I thought it was something that was beyond my capabilities when I was younger, then I came to find out in college that HTML is not as hard as I thought. I love the Freedom and Creativity that CSS brings to the web developing space. CSS is what I am most excited to learn about web development. Once I get a firm hold of the concepts and techniques I am going to make such cool and unique websites. To be able to land a job that is both code and art would be amazing to say the least.
